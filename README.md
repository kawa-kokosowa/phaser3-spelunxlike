# Phaser 3 Spelunx-like Demo (Unfinished)

Wander around a weird area in the vein of Spelunx by Cyan.

This repository was a [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) and JavaScript
learning experience for me.

## Running

Right now I just use `python3 -m http.server` and open
http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.html in Firefox for Ubuntu.
